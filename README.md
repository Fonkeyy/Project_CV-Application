# Project CV-Application

## Project Overview
This project was the first in The Odin Project's React course and served as an introduction to component creation and state management. The CV Application allows users to input and edit their practical educational and personal information. It was a valuable learning experience, helping me understand how to structure code, create components, and manage state in a React application.

## Learning Highlights
- **Component Creation**: This project encouraged me to identify code duplication and convert it into reusable components.
- **CSS Modules**: First use of CSS modules, which is usefull as the project grows
- **File Organization**: I experimented with an organized file structure, creating a separate folder for each component to contain both JSX and CSS files.
- **State Management**: I gained practical experience in using the useState hook to manage component state effectively.
- **Complexity and Component Creation**: I explored the balance between creating more components but increase complexity
- **Introduction to useReducer**: In one component, I implemented the useReducer hook to manage multiple states efficiently.
