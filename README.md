# Project CV-Application

## Project Overview
This project was the first in The Odin Project's React course and served as an introduction to component creation and state management. The CV Application allows users to input and edit their practical educational and personal information. It was a valuable learning experience, helping me understand how to structure code, create components, and manage state in a React application.

## Learning Highlights
- **Component Creation**: This project encouraged me to identify code duplication and convert it into reusable components.
- **CSS Modules**: I incorporated CSS modules into the project for the first time, recognizing their value as the project scales and ensuring scoped styling for each component.
- **File Organization**: I experimented with an organized file structure, creating a separate folder for each component to contain both JSX and CSS files.
- **State Management**: I gained practical experience in using the useState hook to manage component state effectively.
- **Complexity and Component Creation**:  I explored the delicate balance between creating more components to improve modularity and the complexity it introduces, providing a practical understanding of architectural decision-making.
- **Introduction to useReducer**: In one component, I implemented the useReducer hook to manage multiple states efficiently.

## Features
-**Editable Fields**: All fields are editable
-**Customization**: The application allows users to import background images and profile pictures to personalize their CV.
-**Dynamic Tiles**: The user can add or delete tiles as needed
-**Social Media Integration**: The application supports the inclusion of external URLs to social media buttons, enabling easy access to online profiles.
